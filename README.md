# Parkour Action System for Unreal Engine 4

This is a simple parkour action system I designed for Unreal Engine 4 characters. It includes running, climbing, and jumping actions, with environmental checks to trigger appropriate states. This system is modular and can be expanded to support more parkour actions such as vaulting, sliding, and wall-jumping.

## Features:
- Parkour state machine (Running, Jumping, Climbing)
- Animation integration
- Modular system for easy customization

## Setup:
1. Integrate the `ParkourCharacter` class into your project.
2. Bind parkour input in your `PlayerController` or `InputComponent`.
3. Replace the placeholder animations with your own.
4. Extend the system by adding more parkour actions like vaulting and sliding.
